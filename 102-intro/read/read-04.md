# Structure Webpages with HTML
What is HTML and why do we use it? It is a markup language we use to structure a website and its content.
What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element? The opening tag (<h1>), the closing tag (</h1>) and the content (the information in between the tags)
What is it called when you give an element extra information? We can give an element an attribute (class =)
What is a semantic element? A semantic element gives meaning or a role to the text inside (for example, <h1> gives the text the role of a heading at the top of the page)
