## Loops

- Initialise --> seeting an initial value to a variable. First, it reads the right part of the variable (after =), then assigns that value to the variable (before =)
- Declaration --> declare the creation of variables and functions
- Increment --> ++ (adds 1)
- Decrement --> -- (minus 1)
- Iteration --> repetition of a process to generate a sequence of outcomes

  - Each repetition is a single iteration and it's the starting point of the next iteration.

- for loops / while loops / do-while loops
