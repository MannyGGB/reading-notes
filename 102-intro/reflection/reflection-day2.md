# My thoughts after day 2

- The initial excitement is still there. I am getting more **confident** in my abilities too.
- Keeping my reading notes organised is a good revision activity, as I have to revisit previous topics.
- Organising my reading notes also helps to see the progress in the course and find specific topics easily.
- I had to use my teaching skills today with another learner and it helped me assimilate the contents for the day.
