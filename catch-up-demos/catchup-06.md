# Catch-up 06 (20/10/2023)

## Debugging

- Go step by step â€“ test along with console log.
- Use comments.
- Test unfamiliar code in replit.
- Use VSCode to avoid typoes.
- Red squiggly lines.
- console.log is a dev tool, not for the user.

- Review and organise:

  - Global variables at the top.
  - Name variables and functions appropriately.
  - Use blank lines to separate functions.
  - Check syntax and logic (order).
  - KISS (keep it simple stupid) and DRY (don't repeat yourself) --> repetition, selection, logic.

- Find the errors

  - Syntax --> look in the console (check the line and the type of error).
    -Error messages --> look for clues.

  - Logic and bugs

    - What part of the code is responsible?
    - Is it actions not happening? Wrong values? Wrong order?
    - Use console.log in variables and lines not working.

  - Sources
    - Breakpoints --> used to run the code and stop at specific points on the console. (click on the line)
      - debugger; on VSCode to stop the code at specific points.
    - Watch --> to check variables.
