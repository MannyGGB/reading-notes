## Intro to Next.js

- Add "dev": "next dev" to "scripts"
- Create app folder:
  - layout.tsx (created by next.js) --> controls the layout of the page and we can add tags here to go on different pages (top level layout).
  - page.tsx ()
- .next folder --> used to run the app on the browser (if not working, delete for the app to create it automatically again).
- rm -rf .git --> deletes the git folder, in case we forget the .gitignore before git push. After thsi command, we need to make sure we have the .gitignore, then git init again.
