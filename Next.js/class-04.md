## Page Url Params and Query Strings

(https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/page)

URL parameters and query string values are both used to send data to the server when making a request in web development, but they work in slightly different ways.

URL parameters are included in the URL itself, typically used to identify a specific resource, like a user or a product. For example, the URL example.com/users/123 includes a URL parameter of "123" to identify the user.

Query string values are included in the URL after a question mark and are typically used to filter or sort data. For example, example.com/team?sortBy=asc includes a query string key/value pair of sortBy: asc to specify the sort direction for a list of team members.
