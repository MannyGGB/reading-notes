# Dive into React

## Questions

- What is React? "An agnostic user interface library." This means that you can display an app made with React in different environments (browsers, VR...) in combination with other libraries (React DOM, react 360...). React is used for building interfaces.

- What is a component? "It's a small piece of code that fills a certain part of he user interface that you are building."

- What is the dataflow of React? It is how data is passed from one component to the next. The data goes from the parent component to the nested components inside it. Components are functions and the data is passed down as parameters or props.

- How do we make a React element a DOM element? React code becomes a DOM element when it is passed through a companion library, in this case, React DOM.

- React is a User Interface _Library_.

- Which direction does data flow in React? It's a one-way data flow. It flows down.

- Every component manages its own _state_ and pass it down to its children.
