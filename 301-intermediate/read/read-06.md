- To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience? I was lucky to be part of a team of like-minded people where communication and empathy were very importatnt for all of us. As a team, we also met outside work and we brought our personal ives into work sometimes. We did not feel afraid of speaking up and having hard conversations because we felt supported by each other.
- How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward? Once communication and empathy norms have been established, team work will flow and everyone will pursue common aims.

- Who is Roy Fielding? He was involved in the creation of web servers and the http web protocol. He did research on the way the web works.
- Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? Our techniques were originally designed to be understood by a group of machines at a time. However, we now need a way for two machines to communicate and share information belonging to a third machien, for example. This global communication is important when buiding APIs or "Web Services," since the idea is that machines will be able to use the we as we do.
- What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? REST stands for representational state transfer and provides a definition of a "resource." It is a way of building webs.
- What does a GET do? GET is used by systems to retrieve information from each other.
- What does a POST do? A system can use POST to add something to another system.
- What does PUT do? PUT is useful to replace something in another system.
- What does PATCH do? PATCH partially updates a system.
