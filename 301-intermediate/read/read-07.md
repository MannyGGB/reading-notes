- What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

  1. Greater efficiency: although it might take slightly longer, pair programming creates higher-quality code, and allows the developers to discuss solutions out loud.
  2. Engaged collaboration: having another developer to ask for help and keeping you engaged in the task can definitely boost your confidence.
  3. Learning from fellow students: working together brings up different solutions to the same problem, and you can usually find skills that complement each other.
  4. Social skills: pair programming improves communication and interpersonal relationships.
  5. Job interview readiness: pair programming can be a part of a job interview, so it's good practice!
  6. Work environment readiness: pair programming is a staple in any workplace.

- In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial? Personally, I like collaborating with someone to keep myself engaged in the task. I find myself held accountable, so I keep my motivation running for longer. I am also less prone to giving up because I am supported by another classmate.

- How does pair programming work? There are two roles: the driver and the navigator. The driver is typing the code, and handling the most mechanical aspects of coding (text editor, documents...). The navigator guides the driver, thinking about the big picture, using documentation, and checking for typos or bugs. The navigator does not touch the keyboard to code; that's the driver's task.
