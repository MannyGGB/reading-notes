## Lab recap

- node.js allows to run JS outside the browser.
- Before naming a component, make sure you know if it is only one or multiple items, so you avoid problems with the structure (e.g. is it hornedBeast or hornedBeasts?).
- use rfc to create export default function faster.
- props is passed as an object.
- const [stateVariable, mutationFunction] = useState(initialValue)
  const [likes, setLikes] = useState(0)

- onClick= can go on any HTML tag
- When state variable changes, the page re-renders to show the updated value.

## Passing functions as props

- Functions pass the same as variables, without ()

## Conditional rendering

- Only shows a modal (element on display that changes) when a condition is met.
- We use useState(true/false)
