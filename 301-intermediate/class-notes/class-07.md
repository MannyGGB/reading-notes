## Express Servers

- cors --> bridge between client and server, so they can communicate. Cross Origin Resource Sharing
- Terminal:
  - npm init -y (for default answers)
  - npm i express cors dotenv (installs 3 server packages)
  - npx kill-port 8080 --> when the server can't use the port, kill all ports and do node server again
  - node server --> show server on browser
