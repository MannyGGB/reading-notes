# Catch-Up 03 (18/10/2023)

- Git Branching

  - When GitHub merges a branch into main, it rebases the data --> it goes through the previous commits in main and merges all that information too plus the commits in your branch.
  - git branch --> shows a list of branches (press q to quit)
  - git checkout -b nameofbranch --> create new branch
  - git checkout nameofbranch --> go to that branch or main
  - git push -u origin nameofbranch --> push to a specific branch

- GitHub

  - When creating a pull request, you can add a link to a trello ticket in the comment section.
  - Always git pull after merging branches to update local.
  - Resolve conflict to manually resolve merge conflicts.
    - Select content you want to keep and delete markers.
