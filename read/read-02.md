# The Coder's Computer
- What are four important features to look for in a text editor?
    - code completion (to reduce repeating code)
    - syntax highlighting (to have a general view of the different code elements)
    - a nice variety of themes (I need this for my colour blindness)
    - extensions available (like Live Server or Prettier)
- What do the following commands do?
pwd (prints your current directory)
ls (shows the files in a directory)
cd (goes to the main directory. If you specify a directory after cd, it will take you there)
mkdir (creates a directory)
touch (to create a file with no content)

- Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
cd projects (move to the folder projects)
mkdir new-project (creates a new folder called new-project)
touch new-project/newfile.md (creates a markdown file in the new-project folder)
cd .. (takes you to the previous directory â€“ one level up)
ls projects/new-project (shows all the files in new-project folder, in this case, just newfile.md)
