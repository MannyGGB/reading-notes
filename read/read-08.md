# Operators and Loops
What is an expression in JavaScript? An expressions gives you a value when it is resolved. x = 2 + 1 // this expression gives you the value 3
Why would we use a loop in our code? When you want an action to be repeated without writing the code multiple times
When does a for loop stop executing? When the condition is not met anymore (the value of the expression is false)
How many times will a while loop execute? It will execute infinitely unless there is a condition which evaluates to true.
