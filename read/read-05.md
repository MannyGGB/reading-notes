# Design Webpages with CSS
What is the purpose of CSS? CSS allows you to change the looks of a webpage. You can format the website to match the wireframe.
What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
    - External CSS: You can add a style sheet that you can link to your HTML.
    - Internal CSS: You can add CSS elements directly onto your HTML page with the <style></style> element added to the <head>
    - Inline CSS: to change individual elements on the HTML, you can add style= within the HTML element (<h1 style=>)
Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.
p {
    color: red;
}
