# A Look into Markdown

Markdown allows you to change the look of any plain text. Instead of using buttons to do so, like in *Microsoft Word*, you add elements into the text for those changes to appear.
But why would you learn a new way of formatting a text when *Word* is right there? 
**Good question!** Markdown is very flexible and you can use it on any platform or device, now and forever! 
You can create websites, books, essays, anything that you can imagine. Because of its simple design, you can fully read the text you are writing even with the Markdown symbols.

Let's have a look a some **Markdown syntax**:
- For a heading, add a \# and a space before your title. For example, \# A Look into Markdown 
  - You can also have sub-headings. Simply add up to six \# to see your title get smaller and smaller. For example, \#\#\#\#\#\# A Look into Markdown
  - You need one \# for the largest heading and six \# for the smallest one.

- Let's say you want to use **bold** and *italics* in your text. Don't fret!
  - Add two \* before and after a word for **bold**, and one \* before and after the word for *italics*. For example, if you write \*cat\*, the word would be italised. If you write \*\*cat\*\*, the word would be bold.
  - You can also use \_, but not in the middle of a word. \* is preferred.

- Now let's add some links!
  - Write the name of the website in between [] followed by the URL in between (). For example, \[Google\]\(https://www.google.co.uk/\).
  - The name of the website will appear in blue, ready for you to click.
