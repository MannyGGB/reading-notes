# Growth Mindset 

A growth mindset allows me to develop my own abilities by:
- **Challenging** myself to learn something new.
  - Always remembering to take a step back and rest, if it gets too frustrating.
- Accepting that my learning abilities are not stagnant.
   - You can develop your learning abilities by finding new challenges.
- Finding the **motivation** to overcome obstacles.
  - Some obstacles might look unsurmountable, but there is always a way.
- Asking for **help**.
  - Sometimes asking for help involves some criticism. It is never personal. Take what's useful for you nad leave the rest.
    
## Reminders
1. Always be *kind* to others.
2. If you put some *effort* in, you will improve.
3. Don't be scared of asking for help, even if it makes you feel insecure.
